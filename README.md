# Multi-Agent Stock Analysis & Advisory Platform

This repository delivers an **AI-powered pipeline for end-to-end stock research, analysis, and investment recommendations**. Built on CrewAI, it uses several agents, each tasked with a specific part of the financial due diligence process, combining real-time web data, news, quantitative analysis, and sentiment checks.

## 🚦 Overview

- **Automates stock research** by collecting and analyzing:
  - The latest global news (geopolitics, government actions)
  - Company financials and key metrics
  - Social and news sentiment (via Reddit, GNews)
  - Market/technical/fundamental signals
- **Generates clear, actionable investment guidance** (Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, etc.)
- **Planned features:** Broker account integration (e.g., Zerodha) and portfolio analytics
